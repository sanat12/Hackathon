 '"My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. \r\nWe have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective."',
 '"I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\r\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas."',
 '"This is my first time using any form of birth control. I&#039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch"',
 '"Suboxone has completely turned my life around.  I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin."',

I am loving this. I have always had a powerful sex drive, and I was resigning myself to watching that fade away. I&#039;m now clearing my schedule for action.

Insertion was a breeze next to no cramping. My periods have remained heavy and do not show signs of stopping. Have gained about 30 pounds have acne and headaches and backache, so now I am wondering what is next. My doctor would not take it out and wanted me to remain on it for a year. It is almost a year so I am finding a new doctor and getting it taken out.","My time with skyla has been an absolute breeze. Ms. Skyla and i have been together since late october 2015 and it has been great. I must admit that the insertion is a bit painful,but you will soon forget. I got cramps for about a weekafter insertion. Nothing that a littlw ibuprofen couldnt tackle. I urge anyone who is thinking about skyla to just do it. I promise it is worth it. Please remember that pain is subjective. Meaning it just depends on the person. ","I&#039;m 27 w/ two kids. After my second child was born in 2008 I suffered from almost daily tension/migraine headaches. I wanted to try Mirena as a solution to birth control and possibly help my headaches. After 4 months my headaches are slightly better but I have had some noticeable side effects; 10-15 lbs weight gain, increased discharge, longer periods, and cramping after sex or exercise. ","Had the Liletta inserted in November. The process overall wasn&#039;t bad, but I also had numbing injections which helped so much with the pain. Just a couple cramps and it was over. Stopped having a period after three months, and the weird cramps I kept feeling stopped around 5 months. Everything was great until I noticed my clothes weren&#039;t fitting anymore. I&#039;ve gained 10 - 12 pounds despite months of a very clean diet, counting calories, and frequent exercise. I also started losing my hair a few weeks ago, and began sprouting chin hair that I didn&#039;t have before, which is making me feel very depressed. I am beyond frustrated and am having it removed in a few days.","I am 25 yrs old, no kids and have never been pregnant. After almost 10 years of being on the pill, my doctor and I decided it was time for some thing different. Insertion was very painful, the first one we were trying was faulty so I had to purchase another one right after to be placed. It was extremely uncomfortable, even after being advised to take 800mg of Motrin! I had my boyfriend bring me to and from the doctor, which I would recommend. After I got home I placed a heating pad on my lower abdomen and slept for about 2 hrs! After I woke up I felt like a completely different person! I had no aches or pains, back to normal! I would highly recommend this to any woman, there&#039;s no more remembering! I love it!"',
 '"Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.","Abilify 20 mg.\r\nI am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&#039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&#039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.\r\nAbilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. \r\nMy thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  \r\nI don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.","Intake Effexor XR 375 mg, and lorazepam for depression and anxiety. My doctor added Abilify and I took it in mornings. It made me foggy. I moved it to Bertie and sleep better overall. I have noticed an increase in irritability which equates to feeling extremely angry by 3 pm daily. I&#039;ve rearranged my lorazepam to reduce that but need more time.

 '"I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&#039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&#039;ll be just like when I was younger.","I love Lutera. I am very sensitive to other forms of birth control. Lutera has been one of the only kinds I can take. \r\r\nPros: light periods, no cramping, no intense side effects, bigger boobs.\r\r\nCons: Brown periods, slight weight gain. \r\r\nI also tend to get a bit emotional 1 or 2 days before my period....however I am always an emotional person so this could just be me.

I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period (even though they&#039;d only last 3 days, 4 days at most) and I wanted to avoid it altogether.  The first two months, it was great.  Then my period arrived a month early and the bleeding lasted for 25 days, mostly light.  I had already picked up my next 90 day pack so I figured I&#039;d try to get through that and if I still had the bleeding, I&#039;d talk to my doctor about another birth control.  No need to do that because Jolessa is now working perfectly for me.  It&#039;s been wonderful not having a period for a few months.  I&#039;d recommend this birth control to anyone."',

I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&#039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant.

I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&#039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted.

 '"Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework.

After starting out with the over the counter meds, then moving to prescription Motrin, Day trip, Rendering, and numerous anti depressants, my doctor began prescribing Vicodin 5/500. At first they worked, but after 3months, nothing! So I went back to my doctor and told him. He then proceeded to put me on 7.5/750, again they worked for me no longer after 3 months.

I went to the hospital and the doctor said it didn&#039;t work good enough so he had me go home and do a second round. I went back the next day and did the process with no energy. I had to do it last night and it was even worse than the other times. I was gagging it down and up all night with severe cramps.

It has been an interesting experience because the drug is definitely not an appetite suppressant, yet it does help you control the urge to eat. I have had mild side effects - some stomach discomfort and slight headaches along with constipation, but it has all been easily manageable. If you are considering taking this medication please keep in mind that you still need to do the work by exercising and eating right, but the medication really does help. It has helped me get my motivation back to exercise, and it definitely helps with cravings to eat making it easy to just eat what I need to be healthy.

However, I still haven&#039;t lost any weight at all, but I think that was because when I first started Trulicity I was taking it with Glimepiride and that one has a side effect of weight gain so I think the two meds were fighting each other lol.

As soon as Mirena was removed my weird stomach pains stopped, but I&#039;m still trying to lose the extra weight. \r\n\r\n","I am torn by the Nuvaring. The convenience is great. There is no daily time to take a pill, only once a month which can easily be marked on a calender or put into a phone. It never falls out, I never feel it and changing it is simple, too. I would give the Nuvaring a 10 out of 10 just based upon the simplicity and the price is really reasonable, too. But, there are some downsides (for me personally). For the first few months, I did not notice side effects, although they are there. I have a VERY low tolerance to alcohol when on the Nuvaring. Very emotional, tired, and strung out all the time. I was on the pill before and none of these happened. I also have longer periods. It&#039;s worth a try, every girl seems to have a different experience!"',
 '"I took the Prepopik for my first colonoscopy (I&#039;m 25) and I found it to be very effective. The orange flavor was very tolerable. I had no bad cramps or terrible side effects with it, but I had taken magnesium citrate the night before and that had already cleaned me out somewhat. My only issue was I ended up so dehydrated that I showed up to my colonoscopy with a fever. Try to drink as much fluid as you can with this prep! I drank plenty, but there was more liquid coming out of me than going in. Overall, I would recommend the Prepopik. On a side note, my insurance didn&#039;t cover it, but the office I go to had it available. I recommend asking your office if they have it available if insurance won&#039;t cover it at the pharmacy."',

 '"Drinking a few extra 16oz bottles of water during the period after taking the Milk of Magnesia will help stop the painful hard stools constipation usually brings. It will help ease the release. There can be different amount of time you can expect the recommended dosage to work. For me it&#039;s best taken on an empty stomach. No food for 4 hours or more helps speed the desired effect. If it&#039;s been several days since you normally have movements it will also take longer for the effects to begin. Drink water, as much as you possibly can. If diarrhea occurs cut back on water.

I&#039;ve been taking it for about 6 months and I get compliments from Makeup artist and models (I&#039;m a hairstylist) about how good my skin is.  Another plus for me is my breasts went from a small B to a C! I decided to stop taking it for a week and my breasts went small again and my skin is getting a little oily. So I&#039;m going back on. I only take one a day."',
 '"I&#039;ve suffered from panic attacks and anxiety for years.  I took Paxil for many years, but its effectiveness waned, and I hated the weight gain and sexual side-effects that came with it.  I switched to Luvox, starting with 25mg and it worked miracles.  Eventually, I had to move up to 50mg and now for the last two years 75mg.  I have had no adverse effects, and it has been a lifesaver.  Eventually, when my son was diagnosed with panic disorder (certainly inherited from me, much like I inherited it from my mother), his doctor tried Luvox for him, too.  His assumption was that our genetic similarity and our similar diagnosis might be treated by the same medicine.  He was right. Both my son and I are living anxiety-free, panic attack-free lives."',
 '"Awful medicine, the worst. The side effects outweigh the benefit.  Headache the first night, leg and back pain, Sensitive skin,  just awful. Pain got worse and worse. I changed my meds to ciproflaxcin. I have used this in the past so hopefully, it will continue to help. I even questioned the doc at urgent care to see if I can take cipro and she offered macrobid. Maybe this urgent care and this medication is something they get a deal on....stay away from macrobid."',
 '"I&#039;ve been on Latuda for a little under 2 and a half years. It almost completely stopped my psychotic symptoms except I still hear voices now and then, mainly when I try to go to sleep, but there are no delusions or paranoia while on the drug. I take cogentin in combination with it because it causes me to shake a lot. Main side effects I experience include anhedonia, shakiness, jaw clenching, and inability to sit still. However, I&#039;m happy with it because it actually works, while other antipsychotic meds I tried did not, and it doesn&#039;t cause the endless hunger that I experienced with drugs like Saphris, Haldol, Zyprexa, and Risperdal. It should be noted I am at the max daily dose, which is 160mg.","I&#039;ve been taking Latuda 40mg once a day in the evening  for 1 month for BiPolar.  I had been on various meds throughout my life for depression started when I had postpartum with both my children.  I am 45 now and my children are 17/14. I was on was Lexapro for depressrion for quite sometime that seems to run its course with me. Oh was diagnosed with MS in 1992 so add that piece to the puzzel.As far as Latuda,  I have mixed feelings. It seems to help me with focus and cognitive deficiencies, which I could be MS related.  Depression is there but not as it was, but I still cry and at times stay in my head too long.  I seem to be more agitated with my children.  Ativan helps with Anxiety when needed. I will be seeing my psych tomorrow to discuss."',
 '"I&#039;ve seriously only been using Epiduo for four days and have seen A HUGE improvement. My skin is a little dry but I use Cetaphil moisturizer to balance it out. I am also using Doxycycline along with the topical treatment (Epiduo) and my acne is getting soooo much better. LOVE IT!"',
 '"This cream is absolutely horrible. I will admit the cream initially does what is says it will do, gets rid of the redness. However this is completely temporary, around 6 hours in my experience. What comes afterward is a serious rebound. I spent the day outside in the cold weather (normally a trigger for me, which would normally warrant redness) and when I came back in around 6 hours later my face has never felt hotter in my life. My skin burned and was unbelievably deep red, it looked as if I had held my face up against a fire. This lasted around 2-3 hours. I used it once more thinking my skin needed to get used to it and the results were even worse. I threw away all of my samples after 2 days."',

I don&#039;t think I have gained weight due to me being sick and therefore don&#039;t eat as much as I normally do but I did not lose weight like I normally do when I&#039;m sick. I have been getting cramps which I don&#039;t normally get except the first one or two days of my period. I have been really depressed and I&#039;m not a depressed person.

What more can I take. Only 39. Now have other medical problem from straining do much over the years."',

I take vicodin as needed to alleviate &#039;breakthrough&#039; pain, i.e., occasional pain so great that my usual daily maintenance dose of Embeda ER (morphine/naltrexone) cannot relieve it. It works well, with the usual opioid side effects, hence a score of 8."',
 '"I just started this medication on April 1st and after 3 days I started seeing the effects and I can see it&#039;s taking it&#039;s course and working so far. The doctor started me on 40mg two times a day for 4 months. So far only side effect is dryness which was to be expected. "',
 '"Been dealing with restless leg syndrome.for about 2 years. It kept me from falling asleep. First they gave me flexiril. And it did nothing. Than a miracle came about and I was prescribed reprinol and my legs haven&#039;t twitched since . Amazing drug I must say. My sleep has improved greatly"',
 '"I dreaded the side-effects and had NONE.  I had the intravenous infusion three days before Christmas 2011 and was scared that I would be flattened by the supposed side-effects like flu-like symptoms, bone ache and so forth and was pleasantly surprised.  I am having my second one in just ten days time and hopefully it will be a repeat of the first one."',
 '"This is a very good medication IMO.  When you titrate up to the dose intended, you will notice subtle differences.  Many times I have thought that this had flattened me out but when I backed off the dose, symptoms came roaring back.  No noticeable side effects for me.  Helps stability very well, maybe the cause of some anxiety not much tho."',
 '"Have tried Paxil and Lexapro which sent me into hyper-panic and GAD. I was about to give up on medicines and accept my miserable anxiety as a fact of life when my Doctor recommended Buspirone. I noticed my anxiety began to taper the second day I took the medication. No real side effects to speak of through my first week. The one thing it has delivered for me, HOPE!"',
 '"I have been suffering with this anxiety problem for years and it was starting to interfere with my life.  I am a confident person socially, but my fear of presentations was huge and I would my voice would tremble to the extent where it sounded like I was full on crying. I researched medication for this fear and found propanolol. My doctor prescribed me with 80mg Half Inderal (Propanolol) and despite what some say, he was not hesitant about giving me a prescription and said he regularly gives it to musicians/public speakers etc. It has worked wonders for me, I no longer embarrass my self and now feel happy and confident. You may still feel nervy, but the adrenaline does not kick in. I have not suffered any symptoms and only take it seldomly."',
 '"My 9 year old son has been on various medicines for ADHD since he was 6. We just switched to Focalin 10 mg about 2 weeks ago. We are noticing that by about 1:00 in the afternoon it is completely out of his system and there is no focus. We are going to try a booster dose of 5 mg in the afternoon. I&#039;m going to talk to our doctor about lowering his morning dose because he feels shaky and tired, which I thought would have subsided by now. His focus is terrific but I wonder if we can get the same results by knocking down the dose a bit and adding the booster. Other than that, his sleep and eating habits are the same. Whew!"',
 '"I took Jolivette 6 weeks after I went home with my first baby.  A year after we went on vacation for four days and I forgot it at home. After vacation I took it and everything was fine. A week later I got my period. I thought it wasn&#039;t a big deal, or was maybe because I miss all those days. It last 5 days. 2 weeks after that again but now lasting 7 days. Then I started to get my period every week and now every 3 days! Lasting 7 days! Worked amazing in the beginning but I messed it up."',
 '"I was prescribed this medicine for bronchitis, 500mg. for 7 days. It really cleared up the bronchitis, but left me with bad tendonitis in my right leg.  No telling how long this will go on.  I can barely walk when I first get up in the morning, although it gets better with gentle exercise.  I too have noticed crazy dreams, no dizziness, but I think it is causing me to make some bad decisions.  Do not take this medicine for anything under any conditions.  Find some other drug.  The side effects are unpredictable, come on after you have already stopped taking it, and are miserable.  I&#039;m going to try some of the remedies the other reviewers have mentioned."',
 '"I have been using Qsymia for a little over 3 months. I have lost 50 pounds. I&#039;m 30, have 1 child and couldn&#039;t lose weight no matter how long I stayed in the gym. There is no magic pill that works for weight loss without DIET AND EXERCISE! You need to do these things to see these type of results! I will say in the beginning my side effects were awful I always felt tired but I pushed passed that and it went away. I have since gone off my blood pressure medicine as well. I would recommend following closely with your doctor if you are on BP meds though because my blood pressure dropped so quick I was fainting. Not from Qsymia but from getting healthy so fast.","I have been on the Qysmia for 3 weeks now.  I wanted  to wait a few weeks  to give a review. I have a very slow metabolism so I  did not lose as much as some in the first two weeks  upon taking.  My weight started at 198.  I am down to 193. So I  have lost  5 lbs in 3 weeks.  But that  is with  out cardio.  My  appetite  is suppressed.  Dry mouth.  So drink a lot of water. Tingling almost numbness in my feet at times but it goes away shortly after. The  medication  if not covered  or with the free trial  is expensive.  So be prepared.  I guess it  is cheaper  than weight loss surgery.  But it&#039;s no magic pill neither.  Like any other pill  you must eat right and exercise. To lose the weight.  Well that&#039;s  my take anyway."',
 '"I try not to take medicine unless I am really sick but my doctor recommended I take cephalexin for a small cyst on my eye lid.  I decided to try it because antibiotics are one of the medicines I believe are very good when you are sick and your body needs a little help to heal.  My dosage was three 500mg per day for 10 days.  After the first day I developed stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I was not sure if it was due to the medicine so I continued to take the cephalexin for two more days.   When the condition did not get any better I stopped taking the cephalexin.  It has now been a week since I first took the cephalexin and I still have stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I advised my doctor&#039;s office of my problem but they have not called me yet."',
 '"I took Aviane for about 3 years. I gained very little weight when I began taking it, but quickly dropped the lbs when I started paying attention to how I was eating. I never had any issues with an irregular period or acne, but my main side effect was moodiness. It took me a couple of years to figure out why I&#039;d become this hyperemotional person, but then after much research, realized it was the Aviane. I began to pay attention to my moods and regulate my mood swings, which helped. I&#039;ve been off the pill for over a year now, but if I had to go back on birth control, I would choose this one again."',
 '"I&#039;ve been on this medication almost a full month. I never feel hungry and have been eating WAY less than I ever have, however the scale has not moved. Bad heartburn has been my only side effect. I&#039;ll try it one more month and then if no weight loss, I&#039;m going to stop. Disappointed...and I had to pay $1,000 out of pocket!"',
 '"This med caused me to hear internal voices (auditory hallucinations, but in my head). Made me paranoid, anxious, scared to be alone, tired, nauseated, no appetite,  and felt schizophrenic.

 '"Depo has been great for relief of pain from endometriosis. I am on my 3rd shot. No more period, but I do spot the whole month before the next shot is due. I am hoping that will stop as my body gets used to it more. The shot is painless, the only side effect I have noticed is minor weight gain and my sex drive has decreased a bit. I am okay with that at least the pain is gone. I got scared reading what everyone had to say about this drug and almost didn&#039;t get it. I am glad I took the chance to see how &quot;I&quot; reacted to it. Everyone is different. I am very satisfied with it."',

I still get blackheads and have milia on my chin/jawline but no pimples/whiteheads/cysts to speak of and have had no issues with dry skin.

 '"I was prescribed Restasis by my ophthalmologist due to severe dry eye caused by Accutune. I was given a card that gave me a discount since I did not have private health insurance and used each vile over 2-3 days so that it became effectively very cheap for me to use. I had side effects at first, burning eyes and blurred vision. I was told it takes a minimum of 3 months to see any benefits so I kept using it. It worked almost too well, as my eyes started producing tears so much that my eyes would water all the time.

I went to my Psychiatrist and was told that for my condition I should not be on things like Celexa that I was taking at 40mg at night. Those serotonin medications can hype me up especially at night. So the only other medicine I take is Inderal LA 120mg for tremors I have from a neurological condition since childhood. I slept great last night for the first time in a long time. I also feel much more at ease in gathering my thoughts and focus. I just hope it continues and I do my part in staying stable too."',

However one night when I put my cream on and then waking up on the next morning my skin was literally burnt and my forehead was covered in those little spots which was terrible and they looked even worse with make up on because it was extremely bumpy.

In literally one week my skin went from perfectly clear to large acne blotches on my cheeks, chin and neck that were painful to touch. After trying everything in the arsenal at the time (monocycline, benzaclIn, finacea, etc.) my dermatologist recommended Accutane. My only side effects were ridiculously chapped lips, dry skin on my face, and some joint pain.

On top of that from the moment I got my period it was hell. I got my period a month after insertion and ever since then it&#039;s been a smooth ride.

I love this medicine, really. I&#039;m hungry more often, but that&#039;s okay. Unsure what will happen when I stop taking it.","I&#039;m 24 years old and have always had a pretty regular period. I missed a period last month and immediately went to the dr to make sure everything was okay. He confirmed it was probably stress due to the numerous issues I listed and prescribed provera 10mg once a day for 10 days. He said this would make me have a period after the 10 days so that my next period wouldn&#039;t be so bad. Day 1 didn&#039;t sleep for 27 hours. Day 2 I got extremely weak but couldn&#039;t sleep at all and the cramps started rapidly. Day 3 I&#039;m in tears from all the pain and pressure in my lower stomach and back. Day 4 I can&#039;t get up from heating pad no appetite face is broken out in red blotches I&#039;m bloated and feel huge and my mood is terrible. I will not take another pill. Ever"',
 '"So much better than the creams."',
 '"I was prompted to write this after reading some of the negative reviews. God how I wish this would work for everyone. I have only been on it for around 7 months but my first scan was promising (I have bone metastasis and there were no new spots and previous lesions appeared smaller). I go for my next scan in a few weeks. I&#039;m so fortunate in that I&#039;ve had no side effects. Your neutrophils will dip and yes, I&#039;m tired at times but what else is new. I know that some are experiencing terrible side effects but I wanted to chime in and say that not everyone experiences them. I do take spirulina pills and they seem to help get my neutrophils where they should be (above 1.0). If you are a candidate for ibrance, count yourself lucky and try it!"',
 '"Been on Reclipsen for a few months now. Pros- lighter periods, no stomach cramps, no acne, no babies. Cons- mood swings, TERRIBLE back pain during period, lower sex drive, no weight gain (if already active)."',
 '"I&#039;m a 27 year old white male in good shape but have always had high blood pressure...I&#039;m guessing genetic. My blood pressure would run anywhere from 130-160 over 85-105. The doctor tried a diuretic which did nothing, and then a beta blocker which had horrible side effects. They finally tried 10mg of lisinopril and wow how great! It almost immediately brought my blood pressure to 118/80&#039;s. I actually cut my dose to 2.5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg at lunch and my blood pressure stays perfect all day and night. I have had no side effects whatsoever and wouldn&#039;t even know I was taking any medication if it weren&#039;t for my lowered blood pressure. Highly recommend!"',
 '"I have been taking Jardiance for just over a year - I have NOT experienced any side effects whatsoever - MORE importantly this drug has reduced my blood sugar levels to an average of 5 and has maintained this level, quite incredible as nothing else has worked previously - I have named Jardiance as the &quot;diabetic wonder drug&quot; although my Doctor keeps reminding me there is no such thing as a wonder drug - I disagree this is MY wonder drug - thank you Jardiance you have changed my life completely astonishing result."',
 '"I take all types of pain meds but Naproxen doesn&#039;t last an hour before my cramps come back. I just took one and it made my cramps worse and I&#039;m like forget naproxen. One pill doesn&#039;t do jack."',
 '"I had severe vomiting and diarhoea for 3 days caused by clarythromycin. After being treated for dehydration at the hospital, clarythormycin was replaced with doxycycline, and I have no problems since."',
 '"I had my first atrial fibrillation crisis 3 moths ago. They cardioverted me, the doctor put me on metoprolol succinate ER 25mg for the first month and now I&#039;m on on metoprolol tartrate 25mg. "',
 '"I am on opoids for chronic back pain. Used Miralax and Metamucil but was bowel movements irregular and felt like I was emptying out was backing up. Tried 25mg on empty stomach at 3pm yesterday for first time. Started having cramps. Called my doc and added a suppository. Twenty minutes later had massive BM over 30 minutes. None after that. This morning, woke up in withdrawal, cold, nausea, abdominal cramps, horrible pain and feeling lousy. Odd as my last pain med dose was six hours before, and I do not get withdrawals that quickly. My morning pain meds fixed withdrawals but was still in significant pain until 1pm after second pain med dose at 12. Seems to decrease pain reducing effects of opiods."',
 '"Got skyla inserted about a month ago a few days after my last period. The insertion was uncomfortable but not bad at all. Had severe cramps the first week after insertion but it was managed by ibuprofen. I&#039;ve been spotting since inserted but had one week without. Started my period last week and it&#039;s just been light, almost like spotting (very very annoying). I usually have a 5/6 day period but I&#039;m now going into day 8. Hoping the spotting stops soon so I can stop wearing pads. Good luck to all who try this!"',
 '"Received 3-month shot two weeks ago to stop heavy menstrual bleeding in preparation for a hysterectomy next month. My period started and the bleeding is just as extreme as usual. No relief in blood or pain with this drug. Have experience hot flashes (minor), headaches (minor), night sweats, nausea (moderate), and have pain in upper right back area. Will be seeing doctor later this week to get checked on. I know it&#039;s early in the process, but I&#039;m disappointed. I took it knowing about the side effects, but was willing to go along with them to get my bleeding under control and to build up my iron stores."',
 '"This pill works!\r\r\nI decided to share my experience with you because when I had unprotected sex I was searching like crazy to find out a solution.\r\r\nFirstly, I had unprotectes sex august 20th, and the next day I swear, I was extremely anxious and nervous, I was about to die.. I took Ella 30 hours after, and after some days I decided that what I could do, is wait... so I stoped worrying and became comfortable, and I was waiting for my period.. finally it came a week late.\r\r\nSo, because I know the struggle, DO NOT PANIC, this pill is very very effective because you dont get pregrant immidietly.. but remember to always have PROTECTED sex...in case you dont ..there&#039;s ella xx"',
 '"I was prescribed benzonatate today for the third time in the last few years. I have a wicked sinus infection and hacking cough. Every time I have been prescribed benzonatate, I have had a good attitude, &quot;Maybe this time it will work.&quot; Every time I have used it, I have felt like I was given a placebo by mistake. No side effects at all, but it has never worked for me. Not working today either.  Still hacking."']
